# Fine-Tuning Transformer Models (BERT & BioBERT) for Biomedical NER

This project applies fine-tuning techniques on BERT and BioBERT to perform Named Entity Recognition (NER) on the BC5CDR dataset, focusing on extracting disease and chemical entities from biomedical text. It demonstrates model comparison, training, and evaluation for real-world healthcare NLP applications.
